# Trapdoor!

Your objective in the game is to move from the left to the right, and back,
avoiding trap doors!

Platform squares are fixed and won't open.  Some trapdoors are on a timer
and will open and close at regular intervals.  Others will only trigger
once you stand on them for a predetermined amount of time!

How high of a score can you get?
